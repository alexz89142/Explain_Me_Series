# The Explain Me Series
This is my repository of articles I've written

I have found that, unfortunately, there are times where one follows a guide or a tutorial and too many "simple" things go unexplained. I figure that it might be because the authors of said guides assume that people already know certain things that they don't.

My goal is to write articles explain those simpler things that often get overlooked as the assumption is made that everyone already knows what it is  

My articles so far:
